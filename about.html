            <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p>
            I am constantly researching a broad range of topics ranging from advanced medicine, to technology, to ancient history and mythology. I love to learn. I have recently decided that I will take on a childhood dream of mine, to learn to code. I have been building and fixing all sorts of computers for many years and playing with open-source operating systems and software for a long time. Time to take it a step further and start creating my own.

            <p>            
                My peers considder me a diverse personality with endless curiosity. I love exploring the outdoors just as much as I love exploring projects indoors. I have been to over 30 countries, learning from different cultures and learning more about our collective history. 
                I enjoy playing around with computers and networks, it has become so interesting for me that I can no longer find time to watch TV or play games online. 
                My thirst for knowledge allows me to enter with an open mine, any new task or field that I get exposed to. 
                Having interacted with people from all places and all walks of life makes me easy to get along with and difficult to get tired of. 
                I always like to say; "A stranger is a friend you haven't met yet."
