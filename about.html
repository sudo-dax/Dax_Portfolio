                    <p>
                        My intellectual curiosity is reflected in the varied areas I research; subjects as far ranging as medicine and technology to ancient history, mythology and philosophy. As a child I used to dream about being able to use technology to assist me in achieving my goals.  I began building and fixing a variety of different computers and hardware devices and later I found the open-source software movement inspiring.  While my motives may have changed, I'm no longer building robots to monitor movements in my school dorm-room, my experiences have lead to a keen interest in privacy and security in the digital world. These efforts have pushed me to finally take the next step, learning to code and make my own ideas come to reality.

                    My peers reckon I have an endless curiosity and value my unique personality.
                    My thirst for knowledge allows me to meet new tasks and experiences with an open mind.
                    I'm an avid explorer enjoying nature and the outdoors just as much as I enjoy researching and tinkering on projects indoors.
                    I've lost interest in TV and video-gaming since becoming so absorbed in computers and networking.
                    Having traveled through more than thirty countries I have learnt about humanity's collective history while absorbing diverse cultural customs.
                    My peers find that I'm easy to get along with, and difficult to get tired of -- largely because I've interacted with people from many places and all walks of life.
                    I like to say, "A stranger is a friend you haven't met yet."
