            <h2>One People <br>â™¥<br>One Planet</h2>

            <p>In an age where we have the power of all humantiy at our fingertips, <br> 
                yet knowledge itself has been trivialised and taken for granted. <br>
                A time where we focus on public safety at the expense of freedom, <br>
                we must look to new innovative ways to engage society in open discussion to motivate action. <br>
                I believe with the magic of code we can replace and improve old structures which are currently failing us, <br>
                and help us re-connect to the world while we regain our humanity.</p>

            <h3>Paving the Way:</h3>
            <p>We live in challenging times, with a rapidly changing ecosystem and an even faster evolving culture, I believe the time is ripe for people everywhere to start to collaborate on projects that make life easier and more enjoyable for everyone.
                This is a time of paradoxes, a time of great struggle, yet a time of great abundance. Abundance of knowledge and resources, yet they have not yet found a way to travel to those who need it most.
                I believe that coding is the magic in the recipe of life that could bring the ingredients needed to make the world a place to thrive for all.

            <h2>Cracking the Matrix:</h2>
            <p>
                In a world filled with hackers, crackers and cyber phreakers, we are all starting to see the results of not paying attention to security. 
                Cybersecurity is one of my greatest hobbies and I thrive on learning everything I can about it. I believe information security will be an important skill for everyone who wants to publish their businesses or personal informaiton online.

            <p>
                I wrote a CLI application in Ruby which leverages system commands to allow a user to easily change their mac address to obscure their identity on a network.

            <h3>State of Affairs:</h3>
            <p>
                The time has come for people to cooperate. There is no longer a reason for cultures and people to battle between themselves, as we have a greater enemy at our doorstep one that threatens to change the course of history and our way of life. 
                The only way to change this state of affairs is for all creeds and colors to blend as one and work together to solve the worlds problems.
