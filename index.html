  Not all those who wander are lost...

  In an age where we have the collective wisdom of all humantiy at our fingertips, yet knowledge itself has been trivialised. 
  A time where we people focus too much on security at the expense of freedom, we must look for to new innovative ways to engage the public in relevant discussion. 
  With code we can create new solutions and replace old structures which are failing us, we can interconnect the planet while regaining our humanity.
